Transport Classification Model

This project focuses on the development of an image classification model tailored specifically for identifying various modes of transportation. Whether it's distinguishing between cars, bicycles, airplanes, or boats, this model has been trained to accurately categorize different transport types from input images.

Features
Multi-Class Classification: The model is capable of distinguishing between multiple transport categories simultaneously.
High Accuracy: Through rigorous training and validation, we have achieved a high level of accuracy in transport classification.
Robustness: The model has been tested on a diverse range of images and demonstrates robust performance across various environmental conditions and image qualities.

Tools used:
- PyTorch
- Fastai
- Streamlit
